### Install Node.js:


 ![nodeJS image](/images/nodeImg.png)

 
 After you install node.js on your local machine test it in CMD â€“ node -v (should display the version) 
 ```html
 C:\Users\aygun>node -v         ->  v10.16.3
 ```
### Introduction to Node.js and NPM

-	Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime build on Googleâ€™s open source V8 JavaScript Engine. 
-	Node.js enables JavaScript to be run in a different environment than just the browser.
-	The V8 Engine executes the code â€“ parse it and runs it in Node.js

### What is Node.js
![NodeJS why and when](/images/nodeWhy.png)


#### Running JavaScript Outside the Browser

-	Start interacting with node in the command line; - we are going to use the build in terminal
Type-in node  -> this will open up Node REPL  - Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. It is very handy when we want to quickly test a JavaScript code snippet. 
To exit REPL type in .exit or Ctrl + D
Hit tab tab and you will see all the global variables that are available in Node
When you type in an underscore will give you the previous output to use.
Type in String. tab tag will give you the methods of the String class

#### Using Modules: Core Modules

-	Start a new .js file in the root directory
-	Type in some JavaScript code.
-	To run this file in the browser we would have to attach it to an html file;
but this is how we could run it in Node - 
In the Terminal -> command node and the name of the file -> node index.js

``` javascript
const hello = "Hello World";
console.log(hello);

```

-	More advanced features of Node would be reading files from the files system. 
In order to that we would need to use a Node Module â€“ all kind of functionality is stored in Modules; in this case it would be the fs module (file stream). 
To make use of these modules we require them into our code and then store the result of the requiring function in a variable.
const fs = require('fs');

### Reading and Writing Files
	
#### Read from file

![NodeJS why and when](/images/nodeReadWrite.png)

``` javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const textIn = fs.readFileSync('./txt/input.txt','utf-8');
console.log(textIn);
	Run it in node -> this will read and display the content of the input.txt file.
	Write to file
const fs = require('fs');

// ES6 syntax:
const textOut = `This is what we know about the avocato: ${textIn}.\nCreated on ${Date.now()}`;
// Previous Syntax without the backstrings:
// 'this is: ' + textIn;
fs.writeFileSync('./txt/output.txt',textOut);
console.log('File written');

```

### Blocking and Non-Blocking: Asynchronous Nature of Node.js

- Non-Blocking I/O model â€“asynchronous read function - instead of blocking the one single thread this model does the heavy work in the background. Where it stays until itâ€™s finished reading the data from the file.
- We then register a callback function to be called once the data is available. All other users can perform their tasks in a single thread one after another while the file is still being read in the background. In PHP you get one thread for each user.
- A callback in our code does not make it automatically asynchronous. Passing functions in another functions is common in JavaScript. 
![NodeJS blocking none blocking](/images/nodeBlocking.png)

#### Callback Hell 
The callback model - functions is called once the one before has finished its work can quickly lead to some hard to read and manageable code. 
##### For example: 
The second file read depends on the first one; than the third file read depends on the second one; and then the finally we want to use the final data to write as a result. This makes it hard to read and reason about. This problem is called *Callback Hell*. To solve this problem, we can use *ES6 Promises or ES8 async/await*. 
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data1) => {
    fs.writeFile(`${data1}.txt`,'utf-8',(err,data2) => {
        fs.readFile('append.txt','utf-8',(err,data3) => {
            fs.writeFile('final.txt', `${data2} ${data3}` ,'utf-8', (err) => {
                if(err) throw err;
            });
        });
    });
});
```
-	Node was originally designed around callbacks and we still will be using them.

### Reading and Writing Files Asynchronously

##### Example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
//third parameter is a callback function() with two arguments; (err if there was one and the actual data itself.)
fs.readFile('./txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data)  => { 
    console.log(data);
});
console.log('Will read file') // this will run before the callback function. NodeJS will read the file in the background and won't block the code and will immediately move to the next line of code. Once everything is read it will return to the call back funcion to run.
```

read-this
##### Example: Steps that depend on the result of the previous step.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
//third param is a callback function with two arguments; err if there was one and the acutal data itself.
fs.readFile('./txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data1)  => { 
    fs.readFile(`./txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err, data2)  => { 
        console.log(data2);
        fs.readFile('./txt/append.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data3)  => { 
            console.log(data3);
        });
    });
});
```

The avocado ï¿½ðŸ¥‘ is also used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spice
APPENDIX: Generally, avocados ï¿½ðŸ¥‘ are served raw, but some cultivars can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter

##### Example: we want to write the last two strings into a file.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
//third param is a callback function with two arguments; err if there was one and the acutal data itself.
fs.readFile('./txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data1)  => { 
    if(err) return console.log('ERROR');   //error handler 
    fs.readFile(`./txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err, data2)  => { 
        console.log(data2);
        fs.readFile('./txt/append.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data3)  => { 
            console.log(data3);
            // only err argument needed; use template string the data 
               we want to write as an additional argument.
            fs.writeFile('./txt/final.txt', `${data2}\n${data3}`, 'utf-
8', err => {  
                console.log('Your file has been written.');
            });
        });
    });
});
```
The arrow functions syntax is ES6. This is how it would look like without the arrow function:
```javascript
function(err, data1){ //a function always gets the this keyword. }
```
### Creating a Simple Web Server
-	Accepting request and sending back responses â€“ Networking capability
-	For that we need to include another module - HTTP
```javascript
const http = require('http');
```

- Creating the Server is the first part.
```javascript
http.createServer((req,res) => { // takes in two args, request variable and response variable
    res.end('Hello from the server'); // (The response and request objects have tools that we can use )
});
```
Listening the incoming request is the second part. 
In order to do that is to save the result of createServer to a variable
```javascript
const server = http.createServer((req,res) => { 
    res.end('Hello from the server'); 
});
// use that server an on that call listen.
server.listen(8000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    console.log('Listening to requests on port 8000');
});
```
	Run the node application; We can get to this URL on port 8000 on our computer 
##### Output:
PS C:\Users\aygun\OneDrive\Documents\Udemy\The Complete Bootcamp2019\complete-node-bootcamp-master\complete-node-bootcamp-master\1-node-farm\starter> node index.js
Listening to requests on port 8000
